# hAIku
A repo for displaying information about a React Native app I created.

**Motivation**:

The motivation for hAIku came after working with OpenAI's text generation algorithm, GPT-3. After playing with the algorithm I realized it was great at generating metaphors, similies, and personification. Since I had never seen a text generation algorithm so adept at using figures of speech, I decided to create a poetry generation app.

**Goal and Result**:

The goal of hAIku was to create an app that generated relatively complex poems based off a user inputted topic. hAIku succeeds at generating impressive metaphors and similies, and instances of personification. Below are example of poems generated by hAIku:

topic 1: harsh blizzard



      Branches like bones of birds 

      Like feathered fish frozen mid-jump 
      
      Brittle beauty, awe-filled I wondered
      
      
topic 2: deep orange


      Fiery color dazzling
      
      In sun's radiance!
      
      Pure sunlight filling in
      
      
topic 3: warm summer day


      Dog days full of sun
      
      Cool ocean winds howl
      
      Trees sweat perfume
      
      
topic 4: anxiety

      Guilty conscience tickles
      
      Like an insistent finger
      
      Trying to get your attention...
      
      
**Languages and Technologies**:

The bulk of the code is written in React Native. Before developing the app I was familiar with React JS, so React Native was not a difficult langauge to work with.


The authentication is done through Google Firebase Authentication


Database interaction is done through Google Firestore


API interaction is done through Axios


**Compliance with OpenAI's safety guidlines**

Since GPT-3 is a new and powerful algorithm, OpenAI requires developers to implement compliance standards in their code. These standards include best ethical practices and other safety standards. hAIku follow all of the guildlines set forth by OpenAI.
