# hAIku
A repo for displaying information about a React Native app I created.

**Motivation**\n
The motivation for hAIku came after working with OpenAI's text generation algorithm, GPT-3. After playing with the algorithm I realized it was great at generating metaphors, similies, and personification. Since I had never seen a text generation algorithm so adept at using figures of speech, I decided to create a poetry generation app.

**Goal and Result**\n
The goal of hAIku was to create an app that generated relatively complex poems based off a user inputted topic. hAIku succeeds at generating impressive metaphors and similies, and instances of personification. Below are example of poems generated by hAIku:

topic: harsh blizzard
poem: Branches like bones of birds 
      Like feathered fish frozen mid-jump 
      Brittle beauty, awe-filled I wondered
      
topic: deep orange
poem: Fiery color dazzling
      In sun's radiance!
      Pure sunlight filling in
      
topic: warm summer day
poem: Dog days full of sun
      Cool ocean winds howl
      Trees sweat perfume
      
topic: anxiety
poem: Guilty conscience tickles
      Like an insistent finger
      Trying to get your attention...
